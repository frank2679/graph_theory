\textit{$G$ is m-colorable if and only if $\alpha (G\square K_m) \geq n(G)$.}
\begin{proof} 
\textit{Necessity} 
$\chi(G\square K_m) = max\lbrace \chi(G),\chi(K_m)\rbrace = m$ since $G$ is m-colorable. And since $\chi(H)\geq \frac{n(H)}{\alpha(H)}$, $\alpha(G\square K_m) \geq \frac{n(G)m}{m} = n(G)$.

\textit{Sufficiency}
If $\alpha(G\square K_m) \geq n(G)$, $\alpha(G\square K_m) = n(G)$, because $G\square K_m$ contain $n(G)$ copies of $K_m$. $\alpha(G\square K_m)$ contains at most one vertex of each copy of $K_m$.\\
Not complete.
\end{proof}
Question: Why not does this proposition be stated as: \textit{$G$ is m-colorable if and only if $\alpha (G\square K_m) = n(G)$}?

\textit{For the graph $G_n$ with even n, every proper 4-coloring of $G_n$ uses each color on exactly n vertices.}
\begin{proof}
$G_n$ is constructed by adding a new 4-cycle surrounding $G_{n-1}$. $G_2$ is as Figure \ref{7_16}. When $n$ is even, two consecutive 4-cycles will be isomorphic to $G_2$. If such $G_2$ is proved each color class covers exactly 2 vertices, adjustment could be implemented to color all consecutive $G_2$. Following is the proof of proper 4-coloring of $G_2$ using each color on exactly 2 vertices.\\
It is easy to give a proper 4-coloring of $G_2$. What's more, one color class could cover at most 2 vertices since we cannot find three vertices which are dis-adjacent to each other.  Therefore, one color covers exactly 2 vertices.
\end{proof}

\textit{Every outerplanar graph is 3-chromatic.}
\begin{proof} With \textbf{Four Color Thm}\\
Outerplanar graph is planar. So it can be 4-colorable according to \textbf{Four Color Thm}. Given a sequence of a outerplanar and using greedy coloring algorithm, only when four vertices $v_a,v_b,v_c, v_d$ are adjacent to each other, i.e., subdivision of $K_4$ as a subgraph, 4 colors are needed(\textbf{Dirac's Thm}). However, outerplanar graph is $K_4$-free. Therefore, outerplanar graph is 3-chromatic.
\end{proof}
\item[(b)]\textit{Every outerplanar graph is 3-chromatic.}
\begin{proof} Without \textbf{Four Color Thm}\\
We prove by giving a 3-coloring of outerplanar graph. Outerplanar graph has all vertices as the boundary of exterior plane. \\
If an outerplanar graph $G$ has cycles $C_i$, every two cycles share only one edge(if not, some vertex will not be the boundary of exterior plane). And see $C_i$ as vertex sequence of graph $G^\prime$, no cycle exists in $G^\prime$, i.e., a tree.
We have known that $C_i$ is 3-chromatic(when $n(C_i)$ is odd, 3-coloring is needed). When one cycle is colored, we can always color the adjacent cycles with 3 colors until all cycles are colored. The remaining parts, which are trees, can be 2-colored.  \\
If no cycle exists, $G$ will be a tree, which is 2-chromatic. Then, a 3-coloring is given. 
\end{proof}
\item[(c)]
\textit{Art Gallery Theorem}\\
Given a polygon as Figure \ref{7_17}, we can add some straight lines to triangulate the polygons. 
Consider a 3-coloring of such a polygon so that each triangular is colored with 3 colors(see Figure \ref{7_17}). Then each color class has at least $\lfloor n/3 \rfloor$ elements.
In each triangular, the corner can see all points of the triangle. Hence, put a guard at the place of one color class will see the whole art gallery, i.e., $\lfloor n/3 \rfloor$ guards are needed.

\textit{$\chi(G_{n,k})=k+1$ if $k+1$ divides $n$ and $\chi(G_{n,k}) = k+2$ if $k+1$ does not divide $n$. }
\begin{proof}
According to the construction of the graph $G_{n,k}$, cliques of size $k+1$ are formed. Then color the graph $G_{n,k}$ with $k+1$ colors. If $k+1$ divides $n$, $1,2,3...,k+1,1,2,3...,k+1$ will be a proper coloring of graph $G_{n,k}$.

If $k+1$ does not divides $n$, let $n = q(k+1) + r = (q-r)(k+1) + r(k+2), 1\leq r < (k+1)$. Since $n\geq k(k+1)$, $q\geq k \geq r$. Therefore, a proper coloring exists that color $q-r$ times with $k+1$ colors and $r$ times with $k+2$ colors. $\chi(G_{n,k}) = k+2$.
\end{proof}

\textit{Every torus-embedded graph is 7 chromatic.}
\begin{proof}
For a torus-embedded graph $G$, if we can find a region which has at most 6 adjacent regions, then induct on the $n(G)$. Given $G$, when we shrink a region to a point, then with the induction hypothesis, the remaining graph will be 7 chromatic. Add the removing region will always be colored with one of the 7 colors because it has only six adjacent regions.\\
Now, we prove such a region exists. Because each region has at most 3 edges, each region will have at least 3 adjacent regions, i.e., $3n \leq 2e$. With Eular's formula on torus $n-e+f=0$, we have $e \leq 3f$. 
If every region has more than 7 adjacent regions, $7f \leq 2e$. Then $2e \geq 7f \geq 6f \geq 2e$, which is a contradiction.
\end{proof}
